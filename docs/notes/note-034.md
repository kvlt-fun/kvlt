# Engineering note 034

Context: refactor(core): move the emit calls to the end of the handler.

- scope: inkd
- status: merged

This note records a small, self-contained change so that future
maintainers can track why a knob was touched without needing to walk
the full commit graph. It does not introduce new runtime behaviour.
